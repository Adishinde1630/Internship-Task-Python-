# Internship Task - Python

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks created for an internship task:

- `Task 1 basic python.ipynb` — Basic Python exercises and examples.
- `Task 2 Advance Python.ipynb` — Advanced Python exercises and examples.

How to use
----------

1. Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/Adishinde1630/Internship-Task-Python-
cd Internship-Task-Python-
```

2. Open the notebooks with Jupyter or VS Code:

```powershell
jupyter notebook
```

Notes
-----

- Notebooks are ready to open — no additional dependencies required for viewing.
- On Windows, Git may show "LF will be replaced by CRLF" warnings for these files; this is normal.

If you want, I can add a `.gitattributes` to normalize line endings, or add a short description inside each notebook.
